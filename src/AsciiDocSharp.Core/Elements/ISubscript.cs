    /// Represents subscript text formatting in an AsciiDoc document.
    /// Subscript text is typically rendered smaller and lowered below the baseline,
    /// commonly used for chemical formulas, mathematical expressions, and footnote references.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// In AsciiDoc, subscript text is denoted using tilde symbols: ~text~
    /// This is useful for chemical formulas (H~2~O), mathematical notation (x~i~),
    /// and various scientific expressions that require baseline-lowered text.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <example>
    /// <para>AsciiDoc syntax:</para>
    /// <code>
    /// The chemical formula for water is H~2~O.
    /// The array element x~i~ represents the i-th item.
    /// </code>
