    /// Represents an open block in an AsciiDoc document.
    /// Open blocks are versatile containers that can enclose content without adding specific semantic meaning,
    /// or can masquerade as other block types when combined with attributes.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Open blocks in AsciiDoc are created using delimited blocks with double hyphens (--).
    /// They serve as generic structural containers that can adapt to different presentation needs.
    /// Open blocks can contain any block content including paragraphs, lists, code blocks, and other elements.
    /// A key limitation is that open blocks cannot be nested inside another open block.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <example>
    /// <para>AsciiDoc syntax for anonymous container:</para>
    /// <code>
    /// --
    /// An open block can be an anonymous container,
    /// or it can masquerade as any other block.
    /// --
    /// </code>
    /// <para>AsciiDoc syntax masquerading as sidebar:</para>
    /// <code>
    /// [sidebar]
    /// .Related information
    /// --
    /// This is aside text.
