    /// Represents a verse block in an AsciiDoc document.
    /// Verse blocks preserve line breaks and white space, making them ideal for poetry,
    /// song lyrics, addresses, and other content where formatting is significant.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Verse blocks in AsciiDoc use the [verse] block style and are typically delimited
    /// with four underscores (____). They preserve the original line breaks and spacing
    /// from the source document, unlike regular paragraphs which flow text.
    /// </remarks>
    /// <example>
    /// <para>AsciiDoc syntax:</para>
    /// <code>
    /// [verse, Carl Sandburg, Chicago]
    /// ____
    /// Hog Butcher for the World,
    /// Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,
    /// Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler;
    /// Stormy, husky, brawling,
    /// City of Big Shoulders
