= AsciiDocSharp Library

AsciiDocSharp is a native .NET library designed to parse AsciiDoc documents and convert them into structured models and various output formats. It provides a modern, implementation of the AsciiDoc specification for all .NET Standard 2.0+ platforms.



== Overview

AsciiDocSharp delivers a comprehensive, extensible, and high-performance AsciiDoc processor for the .NET ecosystem. Its objectives are:

* Parse AsciiDoc files into a structured, object-oriented document model based on the official AsciiDoc specification.
* Provide modular, pluggable output converters (HTML, Markdown, etc.), with HTML as the primary focus.
* Ensure broad compatibility by targeting .NET Standard 2.0 (usable from .NET Framework 4.6.1+, .NET Core 2.0+, .NET 5+, and later).
* Offer a solid architectural foundation that is easy to extend and maintain.
* Deliver production-quality code with comprehensive documentation and automated testing.

== License

AsciiDocSharp is distributed under the MIT License.  
See the link:LICENSE.adoc[LICENSE.adoc] file for details.

== Status

IMPORTANT: AsciiDocSharp is under active development and has not yet had a public release.  
No official NuGet package is available at this time. The library is evolving rapidly and breaking changes may occur.

If you wish to experiment with or contribute to the project, you can build it from source and use it directly in your projects.

== Basic Use

Until a release is published, the recommended way to use AsciiDocSharp is to clone the repository and build the project using the .NET SDK:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/AsciiDocSharp/AsciiDocSharp.git
cd AsciiDocSharp
dotnet build
----

You can then add the built library projects to your solution or reference the resulting DLLs.
